Strategy pattern is quite funny and easy to design a pattern. 
This pattern does not have to be added to change the algorithm or common object of the runtime in runtime.

Think of an action game where a warrior has to fight with many villains. 
Fighters have the power / health at the beginning of the game 100% and in the beginning the fighters are in the cut-cut mode, 
meaning that they are in an aggressive mode. Slowly the combatant's health decreases and he goes to defensive mode. 
Then he continues to look for food, and when he gets food, his health again becomes 100% and he goes back to the aggressive mode.
