Each design pattern has originally emerged to solve one problem most effectively.

CodeReuse, which refers to software engineering, is best done by design patterns. 
Design patterns have been scattered in different ways in our daily lives. Thinking a little better, the ideas are shaped by the pattern.

Just like this a few days ago, everyone in my office visited Bhutan tour. 
The project I was in was also complete. I thought it was not bad to visit this village in the village. I went to my project manager for 5 days leave. 
Our working day for a week is 5 days. Office rules have to be kept from 1 month prior to a week's holiday. 
My Project Manager asked me 5 days in the petition and said if I was 3 days I would give you a holiday now. 
Since you are a 5-day holiday, you need to take leave from the resource manager. We have no jurisdiction to leave for 3 days.

Another elder brother said that if you had a 1 day holiday, you could take it from your team leader.
Then I took the application from the Resource Manager, he was happy to be happy with the holiday. I was happy and went to the village.
So what's the matter? If I needed 1 day holidays I could have taken it from my team leader. 
If you needed 3 days leave then you could take it from the project manager. It would have to have been more than 
an administrative or other senior officials.
