Each blog has a subscription option, if anyone wants to get a new post from this blog, then only subscribe via email. 
If a new post is posted on the blog then the link of that post will automatically be sent to that email. 
Going into the blog does not have to check it again and again that no new post has arrived. 
If you want to make modules themselves, then how to make them. ??
