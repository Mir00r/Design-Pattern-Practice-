Think, a programmer is contractually contracted to develop a software for BFC. 
One of the many modules of BFC's software is that the owner of BFC will be able to filter out the amount of transactions in the field. 
For example, in the city of Dhaka in June 2018, you will be able to see how much of the total sold out of BFC's all outlets. 
BFCs can have many outlets / stores in every zone. There are many stores of BFC in Dhaka Zone. 
Now if the programmer has to calculate the total sales volume of Dhaka Zone every month, 
then he will have to calculate the sale of all the BFC outlets in Dhaka Zone every month. For this reason, 
the programmers considered the stores as an NTT to find out the level of each store. Every store has a unique ID, 
there will be a name and there will be a property for how much it has been sold every month.
